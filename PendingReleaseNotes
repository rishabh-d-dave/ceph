13.0.1
------

* *CephFS*:

  * Several "ceph mds" commands have been obsoleted and replaced
    by equivalent "ceph fs" commands:
      - mds dump -> fs dump
      - mds getmap -> fs dump
      - mds stop -> mds deactivate
      - mds set_max_mds -> fs set max_mds
      - mds set -> fs set
      - mds cluster_down -> fs set cluster_down true
      - mds cluster_up -> fs set cluster_down false
      - mds add_data_pool -> fs add_data_pool
      - mds remove_data_pool -> fs rm_data_pool
      - mds rm_data_pool -> fs rm_data_pool

  * New CephFS file system attributes session_timeout and session_autoclose
    are configurable via `ceph fs set`. The MDS config options
    mds_session_timeout, mds_session_autoclose, and mds_max_file_size are now
    obsolete.

* *RBD*

  * The RBD C API's rbd_discard method now enforces a maximum length of
    2GB to match the C++ API's Image::discard method. This restriction
    prevents overflow of the result code.

  * The rbd CLI's "lock list" JSON and XML output has changed.

  * The rbd CLI's "showmapped" JSON and XML output has changed.

  * RBD now optionally supports simplified image clone semantics where
    non-protected snapshots can be cloned; and snapshots with linked clones
    can be removed and the space automatically reclaimed once all remaining
    linked clones are detached. This feature is enabled by default if
    the OSD "require-min-compat-client" flag is set to mimic or later; or can be
    overridden via the "rbd_default_clone_format" configuration option.

* The sample ``crush-location-hook`` script has been removed.  Its output is
  equivalent to the built-in default behavior, so it has been replaced with an
  example in the CRUSH documentation.

* The "rcceph" script (systemd/ceph in the source code tree, shipped as
  /usr/sbin/rcceph in the ceph-base package for CentOS and SUSE) has been
  dropped. This script was used to perform admin operations (start, stop,
  restart, etc.) on all OSD and/or MON daemons running on a given machine.
  This functionality is provided by the systemd target units (ceph-osd.target,
  ceph-mon.target, etc.).

* The python-ceph-compat package is declared deprecated, and will be dropped
  when all supported distros have completed the move to Python 3. It has
  already been dropped from those supported distros where Python 3 is standard
  and Python 2 is optional (currently only SUSE).

* The -f option of the rados tool now means "--format" instead of "--force",
  for consistency with the ceph tool.
